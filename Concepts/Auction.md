# Auction

## What is auction?
Auction is a mechanism where multiple advertisers bid for the opportunity to show their ads to users. Each ad slot goes to the highest-ranked ad based on factors like bid, quality, and relevance. 

## What is the difference between a first-price auction and a second-price auction?
* First-price: The highest bidder pays exactly their bid
* Second-price: The highest bidder wins but pays the second-highest bid (or next best price). Second-price encourages truthful bidding, avoid intentionally lower the price. The bidders will have to tell the truth - get close to the true value.

## What is generalized second-price (GSP) auctions?
Used in search ads with multiple ad slots. Bidders are ranked by bid x quality score, and each winner pays the minimum bid needed to retain their position, typically close to the bid of the advertiser below them.

## What is quality score, and why do we need it?
Quality score includes CTR, relevance, and landing page experience. It ensures that users see relevant, high-quality ads, allowing lower-bidding but high-quality ads to win over higher bids with poor content.
