* display - banner or visual ads on websites
* search - shown alongside search engine results
* native - match the look/feel of the content
* video - Pre-, mid-, or post-roll video content
* social - Run on platforms like Facebook and Instagram

## How do search ads differ from display ads in terms of targeting and intent?
* Search ads **targets** users with high intent based on queries. Display ads are shown based on user behavior or site content, often for brand awareness rather than direct intent.

Cons: More expensive, longer load times, risk of being skipped.
